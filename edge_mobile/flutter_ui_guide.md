# Flutter UI Development Guide (Samsung Mobile)

This document contains the complete step-by-step instructions for setting up, developing, and deploying the Flutter UI for the Edge Orchestrator project on a Samsung mobile device.

## 1. Environment Setup

### ADB Configuration
The Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is essential for communication with your physical device.

**Locate ADB:**
Your ADB is located at: `/Users/sariyarizwan/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb`

**Add to PATH (Temporary):**
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/sariyarizwan/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools"
```

**Add to PATH (Permanent):**
Add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file:
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/sariyarizwan/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools"
```
Then run: `source ~/.zshrc`

## 2. Samsung Device Preparation

1.  **Enable Developer Options**:
    - Go to **Settings > About Phone > Software Information**.
    - Tap **Build Number** 7 times until you see "Developer mode has been enabled".
2.  **Enable USB Debugging**:
    - Go to **Settings > Developer Options**.
    - Toggle **USB Debugging** to **ON**.
3.  **Connect and Authorize**:
    - Connect your phone via USB.
    - When the prompt "Allow USB debugging?" appears, check **Always allow from this computer** and tap **Allow**.

**Verify Connection:**
Run the following command in your terminal:

## 5. Development Tips

- **Hot Reload**: Press `r` in the terminal where you ran the app to see changes instantly.
- **DevTools**: Run `flutter pub global run devtools` to inspect the UI and performance.
- **Theming**: All styles are centralized in the `ThemeData` block in `lib/main.dart`. modify the `primaryColor` and `scaffoldBackgroundColor` to experiment with different aesthetics.
